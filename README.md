The StudCoders EdTech platform emerges against the backdrop of the dynamic evolution of online education. With advancements in technology and changes in learning preferences, traditional education paradigms have expanded to embrace digital platforms. The rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and e-learning platforms has paved the way for a transformative shift in the educational landscape.

Identified Challenges:

Instructors often encounter hurdles in creating and managing courses efficiently, with existing platforms lacking user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive tools.
